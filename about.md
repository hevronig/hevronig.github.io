I'm Gur Hevroni, a PhD student at Oded Beja's lab in the faculty of biology, at the Technion, Israel. I'm studying the interaction of phages and microbes in the marine environment through a combination of 'meta-omics' and 'single-cell' techniques. To put it in other words, I'm trying to figure out what is going on in a drop of sea water, where millions of nano-scale organisms live together. The goal of my research is to extend our understanding of the role of these organisms in global biogeochemical cycles.
