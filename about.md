I'm Gur Hevroni, a PhD student at Oded Beja's lab in the faculty of biology, at the Technion, Israel. I'm studying the interaction of phages and microbes in the marine environment through a combination of 'meta-omics' and 'single-cell' techniques, aiming to extend our understanding of the role of marine phages in biogeochemical cycles.
