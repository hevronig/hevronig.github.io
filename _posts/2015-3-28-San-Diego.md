Before embarking on the trip I made a stop at San Diego State University to visit Forest Rohwer's lab for a check out dive and to pick up some necessary gear for the cruise.
It was a great opportunity to meet with many like minded scientist sharing interest in marine microbial ecology, and get fresh perspective and insights on doing science.

And of course the food and beer, oh!
