title: One last stop 
---


Before embarking on the trip I made a stop at San Diego State University to visit Forest Rohwer's lab for a check out dive and to pick up some necessary gear for the cruise.
It was a great opportunity to meet with many like minded scientists sharing my interest in marine microbes, and get a fresh perspective on doing science.

And of course the food and beer, oh!
