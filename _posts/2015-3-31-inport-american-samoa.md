title: In-Port American Samoa
---

It hits you immediately as you step outside the airplane. Like stepping into a hot, humid greenhouse - Welcome to the tropics!
Ameriacan Samoa's landscape is beautiful. With steep granite clifs, lash evergreen vegetation and of course blue ocean all around.
The Samoan people are extremely warm and friendly, with laidback mentality and always welcome you with a smile.
Local markets offer fresh coconuts, bananas, papayas and taro. Although most produce is dependant on import, so quality may decline as time passes from the arrival of the last shipment of goods.

Stepping on board the NOAA ship HI'IALAKAI for the first time is an exciting experience by itself. There's nothing remotely similar to this ship where I come from in terms of size and facilities.

There are five diving boats on the ship, which are being deployed daily to different research sites.

The quarters are very comfortable and I can see how this ship has quickly turned into a home to the dedicated staff that spends many months of the year on board the ship.

There is a little gym to keep fit while in out at sea.

The ship has a floating hospital and even a pressure chamber! This is very reassuring...
